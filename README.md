# 42PushSwap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, usingthe lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate varioustypes of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for anoptimized data sorting.

## To do list
  
- [ ] 	SEGV when the input is "2"
- [ ] 	problems with input 0  
- [X] 	stack_delete

- [X] 	algorithm_small
- [x] 	algorithm_large

New naming for functions!!!!
- [X] 	push_swap
- [X] 	push_swap_init
- [X] 	push_swap_free
- [X] 	push_swap_error

	
- [ ]   Check readme

## Visualizer

https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer
move <pyviz.py> to main folder
	
	python3 pyviz.py `ruby -e "puts (-0..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`


## Tester

	bash push_swap_tester/tester.sh . 0-10 5

https://github.com/lmalki-h/push_swap_tester
Rename checker_mac to checker
move <genstack.pl> to main folder
chmod 744 genstack.pl
chmod 744 checker
bash push_swap_tester/tester.sh . 0-10 5

## Sanitize (To test)

Add -g in gcc command.

	-fsanitize=leak
	-fsanitize=address
