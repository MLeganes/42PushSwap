# 42PushSwap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, usingthe lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate varioustypes of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for anoptimized data sorting.

Number of approaches in movements

- 2n: 2 Moves
- 3n: Between 2 and 3 movements
- 5n: Between 7 and 12 movements
- 100n: Between 500 and 700 movements
- 500n: Between 5100 and 5500 movements

## Prerequisites

This project is for Mac OS.

## Installation

* `git clone git@github.com:MLeganes/42PushSwap.git` this repository
* `cd 42PushSwap`

## Running
 
* `make`

* Run program with ``` ./push_swap 3 5 7```
  
Run push_swap with ramdons autogenerated numbers:
	
	ARG=`ruby -e "puts (-0..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`; ./push_swap $ARG

Count the operations:

	ARG=`ruby -e "puts (0..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l

## Visualizer

move <pyviz.py> to main folder
To execute it:

	python3 pyviz.py `ruby -e "puts (-0..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`

## Tester

Rename checker_mac to checker.
Move <genstack.pl> to main folder.

	chmod 744 genstack.pl
	chmod 744 checker

To execute it:

	bash push_swap_tester/tester.sh . 0-10 5

## Sanitize

Add -g in gcc command.

	-fsanitize=leak
	-fsanitize=address

## Print traces

Add in header file this define:

	# define PRINT_HERE() (printf("file: %s, line: %d\n", __FILE__, __LINE__))

And used it from any part of your program

	PRINT_HERE();
