# 42PushSwap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, usingthe lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate varioustypes of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for anoptimized data sorting.

## Visualizer

https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer
move <pyviz.py> to main folder
	
	python3 pyviz.py `ruby -e "puts (-0..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`


## Sanitize (To test)

Add -g in gcc command.
